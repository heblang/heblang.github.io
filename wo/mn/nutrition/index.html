  <h2>Basic Concepts of PFC</h2>
  <p>
    <b>PFC</b> stands for the three main sources of energy for our bodies: <b>P</b> for protein, <b>F</b> for fat, and
    <b>C</b> for carbohydrates.
  </p>

          is essential for building and repairing tissues and for metabolic reactions.
        </li>
        <li>

        </li>
        <li>
          is made up of 22 types of amino acids, and 9 of them are essential amino acids that we must get from
          food
        </li>
        <li>
          contains 4 kcal/g
        </li>
        <li>
          main difference between plant and animal proteins is the composition of different amino acids.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Animal Proteins</h3>
      <p>
        Fish<br>
        Eggs<br>
        Dairy products<br>
        Red meat<br>
        Poultry
      </p>
      <p>
        They are complete sources of protein because they contain all 9 essential amino acids.
      </p>
      <hr>
      <h3>Plants (the ones with the most protein)</h3>
      Whole grains<br>
      Lentils<br>
      Nuts<br>
      Beans<br>
      Legumes<br>
      Certain fruits, such as avocados<br>

      <h3> Saturated fatty acids</h3>
      <p>
        found in varying quantities in:
      </p>
      <p>
        Lard<br>
        Fatty meat<br>

      <h3>
        Unsaturated fatty acids
      </h3>
      <p>
        These are found mainly in plant foods and fish. They are not very resistant to heat, so it is better to eat them
        raw.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also unsaturated fats are divided into 2 groups:
      </p>
      <p>
        Monounsaturated and polyunsaturated, products containing them:
      </p>
      <p>
        Fish oil<br>
        Avocado<br>
        Peanuts<br>
        Olives<br>
        Cashewnuts<br>
        Olive, sesame and rapeseed oils<br>

          glycemic index is a very important indicator when choosing carbohydrates. The GI index is a measure of the
          rate at which glucose enters the bloodstream. The higher this index, the faster the glucose enters the blood
          and the sharper will be the jump in its level, respectively the release of insulin. (See an example of a GI

        The glycemic index is a very important indicator when choosing carbohydrates. The GI index is a measure of the
        rate at which glucose enters the bloodstream. The higher this index, the faster the glucose enters the blood and

        table)
      </p>
      <p>
        The harm of fast carbohydrates for the body is that they sharply increase blood sugar levels - this disrupts the
        mechanisms of insulin production. The fact that calories produced by fast carbohydrates tend to be deposited in
        subcutaneous fat also plays a role.
      </p>
      <p>
        Fast carbs include foods such as:<br>
        White sugar<br>
        Jams<br>
        Honey<br>
        Flour products<br>
        Sugary fruits<br>
        Juices<br>
        Starchy vegetables
      </p>
      <p>
        Although in most cases, fast carbohydrates are detrimental to normal body function, they can be beneficial.
        Consuming 20-30 g of fast carbohydrates before a workout (about half an hour before the workout) increases
        overall performance, endurance, and training efficiency.
      </p>
      <hr>
      <h3>Complex carbohydrates</h3>
      <p>
        The list of foods with complex carbohydrates includes most cereals and cereal-derived grains. They contain both
        starch and fiber - while the presence of sugar is minimal. They have a medium glycemic index and are absorbed
        gradually
      </p>
      <p>
        Vegetables and some fruits<br>
        Beans, lentils<br>
        Nuts and plant seeds<br>
        Cereals, whole grain flour<br>
        Bran

  <h2>
    Another crucial concept in maintaining a healthy diet is calories
  </h2>
  <p>
    It's important to ensure we get the right amount of each element every day
  </p>
  <p>
    Many people mistakenly believe that a food's energy value determines its usefulness, but this is not true.
  </p>
  <p>
    To calculate the minimum daily calories, use the formula.Keep in mind that this figure doesn't take into account any
    physical activity during the day:
  </p>
  <p style="font-style:italic">
    <b>for men</b>, minimum = your weight x 24.2 kcal: 80 x 24.2 = 1,936 kcal &asymp; 2,000 kcal

    One of the main principles of nutrition that I advise to adhere to - this is collagen diet
  </h2>
  <p>
    What is collagen? What is the collagen diet?
  </p>
  <dl>
    <dt><b>Collagen</b></dt>
    <dd>
      <p>
        Collagen is a general term for the main structural proteins found in the skin and connective tissues in humans
        and animals and makes up about 30% of the protein in the human body. The principal function of collagen is to
        keep the skin healthy and help wounds and scars heal properly. It is broken down in the body into amino acids,
        which are then used for cell building and regeneration.
      </p>
      <p>
        Collagen is comprised of 19 amino acids (for example, glycine, proline, hydroxyproline, lysine, and arginine).
        There are at least 29 types of collagen. Humans have mainly Types I-III:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Type I exists mainly in the skin, tendon, vasculature, organs, and bone.
        </li>
        <li>
          Type II is in cartilage, and
        </li>
        <li>
          Type III is in reticular fibers (thin branching fibers in connective tissue).
        </li>
      </ul>
      </p>
    </dd>
    <dt><b>The collagen diet</b></dt>
    <dd>
      <p>
        The collagen diet is an eating plan that emphasizes avoiding too much sugar and refined carbohydrates and
        consuming foods high in collagen. Since collagen levels decline with age, eating more collagen can help maintain
        youthfulness, energy, and beauty.
      </p>
      <hr>
      <h3>What are food sources of collagen?</h3>

      <h3>7 possible health benefits of a collagen diet</h3>
      <p>
        Collagen plays an important role in many functions of the body, and following a collagen diet may have the
        following health benefits:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li><b>Improves skin health</b><br>Collagen improves skin elasticity and moisture. As you get older, your body
          stops creating as much collagen, which can lead to dry skin and wrinkles.</li>
        <li><b>Prevents bone density loss</b><br>Collagen is a major part of bone mass. While your body produces less
          collagen as you age, it is important to eat foods that promote collagen production.</li>
        <li><b>Eases joint pain</b><br>Advancing age increases the risk of osteoporosis (weak bones) which can also have
          an impact on joints. Collagen maintains the balance of cartilage in the body, which plays a crucial role in
          maintaining joint health and protecting bones from damage.</li>
        <li><b>Promotes heart health</b><br>Without enough collagen, your arteries can weaken, constrict, and transport
          blood less effectively. Lack of collagen can lead to atherosclerosis, which is a condition in which plaque
          builds up in the arteries and leads to hardening or narrowing.</li>
        <li><b>Promotes hair and nail growth</b><br>Without enough collagen, your arteries can weaken, constrict, and
          transport blood less effectively. Lack of collagen can lead to atherosclerosis, which is a condition in which
          plaque builds up in the arteries and leads to hardening or narrowing.</li>
        <li><b>Promotes gut health</b><br>Collagen is beneficial to intestinal health, aiding digestion, repairing the
          lining of the gut, and promoting the growth of healthy gut bacteria.</li>
        <li><b>Promotes gut health</b><br>Collagen may boost metabolism, which improves your ability to burn fat and
          manage weight.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Although many of these claims have not been scientifically proven, the overall diet recommendations of the
        collagen diet (minus the supplements) often contain many foods that are recommended for a healthy diet.

        To put it simply, the recommended daily intake of fats is at least 0.8 grams per kilogram of body weight, while
        the recommended daily intake of protein is 2 grams per kilogram of body weight. As for carbohydrates, it's
        recommended to consume twice as many grams of carbohydrates as protein

        It is a common misconception that weight loss and shedding are the same process. However, they are not the same.
      </p>
      <p>
        Losing weight doesn't necessarily mean losing only fat mass. It can also lead to a reduction in water mass,
        glycogen, and muscle mass (fat-free mass)
      </p>
      <p>
        When it comes to reducing total body weight, a balanced diet and caloric deficit are usually sufficient.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the other hand, when the goal is to achieve a leaner physique, the focus should be on reducing fat deposits
        while minimizing muscle loss.

            If you want to lose more than 5-10% of your total body weight, the time frame ranges from 12 to 20 weeks or
            more.
          </p>
          <p>
            The average rate at which our bodies can get rid of fat painlessly is less than 0.5-1% of the body weight
            per week.

        <dd>
          <p>
            First, we need to determine the number of calories our body needs to function (BMR - basal metabolic rate).
            The value shows how many calories we burn during a day at rest.
          </p>
          <p>
            The calculation formula is a mathematical model that takes into account our height; weight, age and gender.

            After calculating your BMR, we can calculate the amount of kcal to maintain based on your level of physical
            activity.
          </p>
          <p>
            To do this, multiply your BMP result by your activity rate for the week:

          </p>
          <p>
            This is a safe and reasonable rate of fat loss that will lead to positive changes in physical condition over
            time without sacrificing muscle mass.

                When developing a diet to shed a body, it's important to choose foods that contain unsaturated fats to
                minimize the risk of heart disease. We recommend limiting saturated fat intake to no more than 10% of
                your total caloric intake

    Vitamins are essential organic compounds that help enhance the action of proteins, which, in turn, facilitate
    chemical reactions such as building muscle mass, burning fat, and producing energy.

    While a healthy body and a balanced diet are usually sufficient for most people to synthesize the required vitamins,
    athletes and individuals who engage in intense physical activities may require two to four times more vitamins due
    to their faster metabolism.
