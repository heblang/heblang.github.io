  <h2>Basic Concepts of PFC</h2>
  <p>
    <b>PFC</b> stands for the three main sources of energy for our bodies: <b>P</b> for protein, <b>F</b> for fat, and
    <b>C</b> for carbohydrates.

        </li>
        <li>
          is made up of 22 types of amino acids, and 9 of them are essential amino acids that we must get from
          food

        <li>
          contains 4 kcal/g
        </li>
        <li>
          main difference between plant and animal proteins is the composition of different amino acids.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Animal Proteins</h3>
      <p>
        Fish<br>

        Dairy products<br>
        Red meat<br>
        Poultry
      </p>
      <p>
        They are complete sources of protein because they contain all 9 essential amino acids.

        Unsaturated fatty acids
      </h3>

        These are found mainly in plant foods and fish. They are not very resistant to heat, so it is better to eat them
        raw.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also unsaturated fats are divided into 2 groups:
      </p>
      <p>
        Monounsaturated and polyunsaturated, products containing them:
      </p>

          glycemic index is a very important indicator when choosing carbohydrates. The GI index is a measure of the
          rate at which glucose enters the bloodstream. The higher this index, the faster the glucose enters the blood
          and the sharper will be the jump in its level, respectively the release of insulin. (See an example of a GI

        rate at which glucose enters the bloodstream. The higher this index, the faster the glucose enters the blood and

        table)
      </p>
      <p>
        The harm of fast carbohydrates for the body is that they sharply increase blood sugar levels - this disrupts the
        mechanisms of insulin production. The fact that calories produced by fast carbohydrates tend to be deposited in
        subcutaneous fat also plays a role.
      </p>
      <p>
        Fast carbs include foods such as:<br>
        White sugar<br>
        Jams<br>
        Honey<br>
        Flour products<br>
        Sugary fruits<br>
        Juices<br>
        Starchy vegetables
      </p>
      <p>
        Although in most cases, fast carbohydrates are detrimental to normal body function, they can be beneficial.
        Consuming 20-30 g of fast carbohydrates before a workout (about half an hour before the workout) increases
        overall performance, endurance, and training efficiency.
      </p>
      <hr>
      <h3>Complex carbohydrates</h3>
      <p>
        The list of foods with complex carbohydrates includes most cereals and cereal-derived grains. They contain both
        starch and fiber - while the presence of sugar is minimal. They have a medium glycemic index and are absorbed
        gradually
      </p>
      <p>
        Vegetables and some fruits<br>
        Beans, lentils<br>
        Nuts and plant seeds<br>

  <h2>
    Another crucial concept in maintaining a healthy diet is calories
  </h2>
  <p>
    It's important to ensure we get the right amount of each element every day
  </p>
  <p>
    Many people mistakenly believe that a food's energy value determines its usefulness, but this is not true.
  </p>
  <p>
    To calculate the minimum daily calories, use the formula.Keep in mind that this figure doesn't take into account any
    physical activity during the day:

    One of the main principles of nutrition that I advise to adhere to - this is collagen diet
  </h2>
  <p>
    What is collagen? What is the collagen diet?
  </p>
  <dl>
    <dt><b>Collagen</b></dt>
    <dd>
      <p>
        Collagen is a general term for the main structural proteins found in the skin and connective tissues in humans
        and animals and makes up about 30% of the protein in the human body. The principal function of collagen is to
        keep the skin healthy and help wounds and scars heal properly. It is broken down in the body into amino acids,
        which are then used for cell building and regeneration.
      </p>
      <p>
        Collagen is comprised of 19 amino acids (for example, glycine, proline, hydroxyproline, lysine, and arginine).
        There are at least 29 types of collagen. Humans have mainly Types I-III:
      <ul>
        <li>
          Type I exists mainly in the skin, tendon, vasculature, organs, and bone.
        </li>
        <li>
          Type II is in cartilage, and
        </li>
        <li>
          Type III is in reticular fibers (thin branching fibers in connective tissue).
        </li>
      </ul>
      </p>
    </dd>
    <dt><b>The collagen diet</b></dt>
    <dd>
      <p>
        The collagen diet is an eating plan that emphasizes avoiding too much sugar and refined carbohydrates and
        consuming foods high in collagen. Since collagen levels decline with age, eating more collagen can help maintain
        youthfulness, energy, and beauty.
      </p>
      <hr>
      <h3>What are food sources of collagen?</h3>

      <h3>7 possible health benefits of a collagen diet</h3>
      <p>
        Collagen plays an important role in many functions of the body, and following a collagen diet may have the
        following health benefits:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li><b>Improves skin health</b><br>Collagen improves skin elasticity and moisture. As you get older, your body
          stops creating as much collagen, which can lead to dry skin and wrinkles.</li>
        <li><b>Prevents bone density loss</b><br>Collagen is a major part of bone mass. While your body produces less
          collagen as you age, it is important to eat foods that promote collagen production.</li>
        <li><b>Eases joint pain</b><br>Advancing age increases the risk of osteoporosis (weak bones) which can also have
          an impact on joints. Collagen maintains the balance of cartilage in the body, which plays a crucial role in
          maintaining joint health and protecting bones from damage.</li>
        <li><b>Promotes heart health</b><br>Without enough collagen, your arteries can weaken, constrict, and transport
          blood less effectively. Lack of collagen can lead to atherosclerosis, which is a condition in which plaque
          builds up in the arteries and leads to hardening or narrowing.</li>
        <li><b>Promotes hair and nail growth</b><br>Without enough collagen, your arteries can weaken, constrict, and
          transport blood less effectively. Lack of collagen can lead to atherosclerosis, which is a condition in which
          plaque builds up in the arteries and leads to hardening or narrowing.</li>
        <li><b>Promotes gut health</b><br>Collagen is beneficial to intestinal health, aiding digestion, repairing the
          lining of the gut, and promoting the growth of healthy gut bacteria.</li>
        <li><b>Promotes gut health</b><br>Collagen may boost metabolism, which improves your ability to burn fat and
          manage weight.</li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Although many of these claims have not been scientifically proven, the overall diet recommendations of the
        collagen diet (minus the supplements) often contain many foods that are recommended for a healthy diet.

        It is a common misconception that weight loss and shedding are the same process. However, they are not the same.
      </p>
      <p>
        Losing weight doesn't necessarily mean losing only fat mass. It can also lead to a reduction in water mass,
        glycogen, and muscle mass (fat-free mass)
      </p>
      <p>
        When it comes to reducing total body weight, a balanced diet and caloric deficit are usually sufficient.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the other hand, when the goal is to achieve a leaner physique, the focus should be on reducing fat deposits
        while minimizing muscle loss.

            If you want to lose more than 5-10% of your total body weight, the time frame ranges from 12 to 20 weeks or
            more.
          </p>
          <p>
            The average rate at which our bodies can get rid of fat painlessly is less than 0.5-1% of the body weight
            per week.

        <dt><b>Step 2 - Determine calorie requirements</b></dt>
        <dd>
          <p>
            First, we need to determine the number of calories our body needs to function (BMR - basal metabolic rate).
            The value shows how many calories we burn during a day at rest.
          </p>
          <p>
            The calculation formula is a mathematical model that takes into account our height; weight, age and gender.
          </p>
          <p>
            <hr>

            After calculating your BMR, we can calculate the amount of kcal to maintain based on your level of physical
            activity.
          </p>
          <p>
            To do this, multiply your BMP result by your activity rate for the week:

          </p>
          <p>
            This is a safe and reasonable rate of fat loss that will lead to positive changes in physical condition over

                To calculate the amount of carbohydrates in a shredding body diet, you need to subtract the proportion
                that comes from protein and fats from the total amount of calories needed. After dividing this figure by
                4, you will get the optimal number of carbohydrates in grams.

    I have written menu samples, but keep in mind that nutrition is an individual thing! Guided by the menus, you
    can change the variation of products and number of meals! The main thing is to remember about PFC!
  </p>
  <p>
    Remember to customize your diet plan according to your specific needs and preferences. Make sure to balance your
    intake of proteins, fats and carbohydrates, and to monitor your caloric intake. Avoid overeating, as it can lead to
    unwanted weight gain. Finally, don't forget to include casein in your last meal - this long protein is found mostly
    in cottage cheese and can help nourish your muscles while you sleep, or you can also add protein shakes to your
    diet.

  <h2>Sport nutrition</h2>
  <h3>Vitamins</h3>
  <p>
    Vitamins are essential organic compounds that help enhance the action of proteins, which, in turn, facilitate
    chemical reactions such as building muscle mass, burning fat, and producing energy.

    While a healthy body and a balanced diet are usually sufficient for most people to synthesize the required vitamins,
    athletes and individuals who engage in intense physical activities may require two to four times more vitamins due
    to their faster metabolism.
  </p>
  <p>
    There are several types of vitamins, each with its specific functions and benefits.
  </p>
  <dl>
    <dt><b>Vitamin A (also known as Retinol)</b></dt>

    </dd>
    <dt><b>Vitamin E (also known as Tocopherol)</b></dt>
    <dd>
      Slows down cell oxidation, strengthens the heart muscle, and prevents blood clots.
    </dd>
    <dt><b>Vitamin K</b></dt>
    <dd>
      Participates in connective tissue and bone metabolism, helps with normal blood clotting, and improves muscle
      function, making blood vessels stronger and providing the body with energy.
    </dd>
    <dt><b>Vitamin C (or ascorbic acid)</b></dt>
    <dd>
      Is vital in collagen fiber synthesis, metabolism, and overall body development.
    </dd>
    <dt><b>Vitamin B1 (also known as Thiamine)</b></dt>
    <dd>
      Helps the body to assimilate carbohydrates completely, and its deficiency can cause nervous system disorders and
      paralysis of the lower extremities.
    </dd>
    <dt><b>Vitamin B2 (or Riboflavin)</b></dt>
    <dd>
      Is essential for healthy skin and mucous membrane, and a deficiency can cause stunted growth.
    </dd>
    <dt><b>Vitamin B6 (also known as Pyridoxine)</b></dt>
    <dd>
      Is crucial for amino acid formation, and a deficiency can lead to impairment in the process.
    </dd>
    <dt><b>Vitamin B9 (or folic acid or folic acid)</b></dt>
    <dd>

    </dd>
    <dt><b><i>Iron</i></b></dt>
    <dd>
      Is another mineral that is critical for various bodily functions. It is an essential component of hemoglobin, a
      protein in red blood cells that helps carry oxygen throughout the body. Iron is also responsible for
      hematopoiesis, the process of producing new blood cells. It plays a particularly important role in the health of
      skin, gastrointestinal tract, and oral cavity.
    </dd>
    <dt><b><i>Zinc</i></b></dt>
    <dd>
      Is a trace mineral that is involved in several vital functions of the body. It helps regulate metabolism, plays a
      role in the production of hormones in the thymus gland, and supports reproductive function and hematopoiesis.
      Foods like wheat germ and sesame contain zinc, but deficiency in the body can lead to symptoms such as white spots
      on the nails, fatigue, frequent infections, and allergic diseases.
    </dd>
  </dl>
  <h3>Amino acids</h3>
  <p>
    <b>Amino acids</b> are the building blocks of protein and have numerous benefits for the body.
  </p>
  <dl>
    <dt><b><i>Glutamine</i></b></dt>
    <dd>
      Is an essential amino acid that is particularly important for the immune system. Supplementing with glutamine can

    <dt><b><i>Leucine, isoleucine, and valine</i></b></dt>
    <dd>
      Are branched-chain amino acids that are crucial for muscle building and recovery. They are involved in building
      muscle proteins and serve as a reserve source of energy. These amino acids also help regulate nervous processes
      and stabilize hormonal levels.
    </dd>
    <dt><b><i>Ornithine</i></b></dt>
    <dd>
      Is an amino acid that promotes fat burning and enhances metabolic processes. It has been shown to increase growth
      hormone levels.
    </dd>
    <dt><b><i>Carnitine (which is a derivative of vitamin B)</i></b></dt>
    <dd>
      Is known for its ability to promote fat loss. Taking carnitine supplements can help boost weight loss efforts
      while preserving muscle mass.
    </dd>
    <dt><b><i>Creatine monohydrate</i></b></dt>
    <dd>
      Is one of the most popular sports supplements for muscle building. It has been shown to increase muscle mass and
      strength when taken at a dose of 7 grams per day.
    </dd>
  </dl>
  <p>
    However, it's essential to remember that sports supplements and vitamins are not a substitute for a balanced diet
    and regular exercise.

  <h3>A solid foundation for proper nutrition begins with the creation of a well-curated food list. These food items can
    be classified into three groups:</h3>
  <dl>
    <dt>
      <h4>Recommended</h4>
    </dt>
    <dd>
      <p>Essential for a balanced diet</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Meats, eggs, organ meats;</li>
        <li>Seafood and any variety of fish;</li>
        <li>Low-fat dairy products;</li>
        <li>Whole grains and cereals;</li>
        <li>Legumes, nuts, and seeds;</li>
        <li>Non-starchy vegetables and leafy greens;</li>
        <li>Low-sugar fruits and berries;</li>
        <li>Unrefined oils.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Grains deserve special recognition, and optimal choices include buckwheat, brown rice, wheat, barley, and
        quinoa. When it comes to meat, lean options like turkey, rabbit, chicken, beef, and veal are preferable. Dairy
        products can encompass any variety with low fat content. Among vegetable oils, highly beneficial options include
        olive, flaxseed, coconut, rice bran, sesame, mustard, and avocado oil.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt>
      <h4>Permissible</h4>
    </dt>
    <dd>
      <p>Can be consumed in moderation</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Starchy vegetables, sweet fruits, and dried fruits;</li>
        <li>Durum-wheat pasta, flour;</li>
        <li>Natural sweeteners like honey, marshmallows, fruit pastilles, and dark, bitter chocolate;</li>
        <li>Canned goods, low-calorie jams, and sauces;</li>
        <li>Crispbreads, slices, whole grain bread, lavash, and tortillas.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>It is worth emphasizing the inclusion of permissible sweets in a balanced diet. These sweet indulgences (such
        as chocolate, marmalade, and marshmallows) should only contain natural ingredients without added sugars or
        additives. Additionally, specialized dietary and sports products can be consumed in limited quantities,
        including protein bars, baking mixes, cookies or biscuits, pancakes, and dragees, among other options.</p>
    </dd>
    <dt>
      <h4>Unrecommended</h4>
    </dt>
    <dd>
      <ul>
        <li>Refined sugar, including brown sugar;</li>
        <li>White wheat flour, bread, or dough;</li>
        <li>Any confectionery products, sweets;</li>
        <li>Carbonated beverages, fruit juices;</li>
        <li>Fast food, dry cereals, instant porridge;</li>
        <li>All store-bought pastries, bars, bread.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        While the following products are not recommended, it's understandable that completely eliminating them from your
        diet may be challenging. In such cases, you can moderately consume them. You can include the desired product in
        your menu, but it's important to ensure it doesn't make you gain weight. For instance, you can incorporate it
        into your Breakfast or have it as a mid-morning Snack, or reserve it for days when you do physical exercises.
        Nevertheless, it is advisable to avoid excessive consumption of "empty" calories if you aim to achieve your
        goals efficiently.
      </p>
    </dd>
  </dl>
  <h3>Here is a breakdown of meal distribution:</h3>
  <p><b>Breakfast</b> - incorporate complex carbohydrates, proteins, and healthy fats;</p>
  <p><b>Snack</b> - opt for simple carbohydrates and fiber-rich options;</p>
  <p><b>Lunch</b> - enjoy a light soup along with proteins, fats, and carbohydrates;</p>
  <p><b>Snack</b> - choose carbohydrates or healthy fats combined with proteins;</p>
  <p><b>Dinner</b> - focus on a light protein source, fiber, and a modest amount of healthy fats;</p>
  <p><b>Snack</b> - preferably opt for dairy products rich in protein.</p>
  <p>Now, I will present various meal plan variations with different calorie levels. However, it's crucial to note that
    these are merely examples for you to consider while designing your own menu. I cannot provide an exact prescription
    for what you should eat since everyone has unique food preferences, dietary needs, and potential allergies. Hence,
    it would be inappropriate to give you specific meals. Instead, my aim is to guide you on how to calculate your
    calorie intake and create a personalized meal plan.<br><br>

    To assist you in monitoring your calorie intake, I recommend using calorie tracking apps such as <b>FatSecret</b> or
    <b>Yazio</b>.<br><br>

    Furthermore, you have the flexibility to make substitutions for proteins, fats, and carbohydrates based on your
    preferences. For instance, you can replace rice with pasta, chicken with turkey, or nuts with cheese.
