    <b>Hey, guys!</b>
  </p>
  <p>
    This program for <b>8 weeks of progress</b> of your strength and aesthetic form.

    Here we do not just lift weights, but strengthen our ligaments and joints - which will help to be not only strong,
    but also healthy!
  </p>

    Before starting, do not forget to <a href="../home/day0.html"><b>fix your current private record</b></a> in the
    press/deadlift/squat to compare with the result 2 months after the completion of the program
  </p>
  <p>
    I AM SURE YOU WILL BE SURPRISED!
