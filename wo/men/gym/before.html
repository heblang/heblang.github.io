  <h3>How to choose the right weight for your workouts</h3>
  <p>
    Selecting the appropriate weight for your workouts is highly individualized. I cannot tell you which weight to use
    for each exercise because everyone's strength levels are different.
  </p>
  <p>
    In all working sets, you should choose a weight that will be challenging for you, for example, you can do only 3
    sets of 10 reps (as stated in the program), leaving one repetition in reserve for each set. However, for the final
    set of each exercise, you should go all-out and complete 10 reps with maximum effort.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you don't choose the right weight, don't worry! Even if you perform 8 reps in the final set, giving it your all,
    or 12 reps and expending all your energy <b>WITHOUT</b> compromising your technique, it will still be great. The 3
    sets of
    10 reps are just an example or guideline that we follow, and slight variations won't make a difference if you work
    at 150% effort.
  </p>
  <p>
    Remember, <b>TECHNIQUE IS KEY</b>. As soon as you don't follow, it becomes dangerous! Always control your technique.

  <h3>When to increase the weight</h3>
  <p>
    To make progress, you need to <b>"surprise"</b> your muscles by periodically changing exercises and increasing the
    weight. While varying exercises is straightforward, you can base your weight choices on how easily you complete the
    designated number of reps. If you're already struggling to complete the last rep, it's too soon to add more weight.
    On the other hand, if you can still do a few more reps with the usual load, it's time to add a bit more weight.
  </p>
  <p>It may take some time to determine the right weight for each exercise, but eventually, you'll know exactly which
    weight suits you best. It should be heavy enough to feel a significant load for the last 2-3 reps of each set.
    However, you should perform those last 2-3 reps without violating the technique. For example, if you plan to
    complete 12 reps, you should feel like you want to end the set after the eighth repetition.
  </p>
  <p>
    Remember, what matters most is not the weight your friend uses for an exercise or the weight I use. If you're a
    beginner, don't rush to increase weight, or you'll risk injury. If you've been working out for a while but can't
    achieve the desired results, go ahead and add more weight. You can only determine the correct weight for each
    exercise through trial and error. Be prepared; it may not happen right away. But eventually, you'll progress and
    achieve the desired results.
